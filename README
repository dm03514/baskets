This contains an implementation to calculate the optimum set of loans
given a comma-delimited input file of loans and loan sets in the following 
format:

loan id, loan amount, set id, set minimum, set maximum
...

Usage:

The program should be invoked as:

build_loan_sets.rb -i <input file>

For example:

build_loan_sets.rb -i loan-basket-01.csv

and will generate a file loan-based-01.out.csv containing the allocations.

Input file format notes:

If there are more loans than sets (the usual case), then the
columns for loan sets should be empty; e.g.,

1004,183000,,,

If there are more sets than loans, then the CSV columns should just
be blank, e.g.:

,,14,2000000,4000000
